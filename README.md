# AppliFo
A (soon to be) browser extension or tool which allows users to track and save job applications by saving them in a Google Sheet.

<code> [Date] [Time] [Name of Organization*] [URL of the Current Page] </code>

All the fields are optional and selected by the user. The extension copies these values to the clipboard as a single string with TABs betweeen each value to make it easier to paste in Google Sheets, MS Excel or Mac Numbers. 

Support for Google Sheets API coming soon.
